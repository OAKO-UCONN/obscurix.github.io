    <p>
      Obscurix is a live operating system based on Arch Linux that is heavily configured for privacy, security and anonymity. It safely forces all traffic through the Tor network, has support for other networks such as I2P and is hardened a lot for security. All data is lost at shutdown as it is run from RAM. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Obscurix is not finished yet. It is still in alpha.</b>
