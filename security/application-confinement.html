    <h1>Application Confinement</h1>

    <p>
      Applications in Obscurix are restricted as much as possible with AppArmor and bubblewrap.
    </p>

    <h2>AppArmor</h2>

    <p>
      AppArmor is a MAC (Mandatory Access Control) system which restricts what applications can do. By default, it blocks access to every file unless it is whitelisted in a profile. AppArmor profiles are configured for a number of different applications such as the Tor Browser and Tor daemon.
    </p>

    <h2>Bubblewrap</h2>

    <p>
      Bubblewrap is a sandboxing program that uses Linux namespaces, seccomp and Linux capabilities to isolate applications. Obscurix uses this for many applications such as the Tor Browser and Hexchat. <br>
      <br>
      Firejail is not used as it adds a lot of attack surface for privilege escalation, has had trivial privilege escalation vulnerabilities in the past and it may even worsen security.
    </p>

    <h2>Systemd Sandboxes</h2>

    <p>
      Systemd allows you to sandbox systemd services. Obscurix sandboxes as many services as possible.
