    <h1>Kernel Hardening</h1>

    <p>
      This page documents all of the things done to harden the kernel. Obscurix uses the default linux kernel from the Arch Linux repositories. In the future it may use linux-hardened or a custom kernel for enhanced security.
    </p>

    <h2>Sysctl Changes</h2>

    <p>
      Sysctl is used to change some settings in the kernel for increased security. They are documented below. <br>
      <br>
      <span class="code">kernel.dmesg_restrict=1</span> is set to restrict the kernel logs to root only. This prevents an attacker from learning more about the system and what to exploit. <br>
      <br>
      <span class="code">kernel.kptr_restrict=2</span> is set which hides the kernel symbols in /proc/kallsyms to prevent an attacker from using them to learn more about what to attack on your system. <br>
      <br>
      <span class="code">kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1</span> is set which restricts the BPF JIT compiler to root only. This prevents a lot of possible attacks against the JIT compiler such as heap spraying. <br>
      <br>
      <span class="code">net.core.bpf_jit_harden=2</span> is set which hardens the JIT compiler against certain attacks such as heap spraying attacks. <br>
      <br>
      <span class="code">kernel.yama.ptrace_scope=2</span> is set which restricts the use of the ptrace() syscall to root only. ptrace can be used to inspect and modify running processes which is very dangerous. <br>
      <br>
      <span class="code">kernel.kexec_load_disabled=1</span> is set which disables kexec as it can be used to livepatch the running kernel. <br>
      <br>
      <span class="code">net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies=1</span> is set to enable TCP syncookies which prevents SYN flood attacks (a type of DoS). <br>
      <br>
      <span class="code">net.ipv4.tcp_rfc1337=1</span> is set which prevents time-wait assassination attacks. <br>
      <br>
      <span class="code">net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter=1</span> and <span class="code">net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=1</span> are set which prevents certain IP spoofing methods. <br>
      <br>
    </p>

    <div class="code">
      net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects=0 <br>
      net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_redirects=0 <br>
      net.ipv4.conf.all.secure_redirects=0 <br>
      net.ipv4.conf.default.secure_redirects=0 <br>
      net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_redirects=0 <br>
      net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_redirects=0
    </div>

    <p>
      are set which disables ICMP redirect acceptance. <br>
      <br>
      <span class="code">net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects=0 <br>
      net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects=0</span> are set which disables ICMP redirect sending. <br>
      <br>
      <span class="code">net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_all=1</span> are set which makes your system ignore ICMP requests. <br>
      <br>
      <span class="code">vm.mmap_rnd_bits=32
      vm.mmap_rnd_compat_bits=16</span> are set which improves ASLR effectiveness for mmap. <br>
      <br>
      <span class="code">net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps=0</span> is set which disables TCP timestamps. These can be used to find out your system time which can be an identifier. <br>
      <br>
      <span class="code">net.ipv4.tcp_sack=0</span> is set which disables SACK. SACK is commonly exploited and rarely used. <br>
      <br>
      <span class="code">kernel.sysrq=0</span> is set which disables the SysRq key. The SysRq key can be used to run arbitrary commands that would normally require root so it is best to disable it. <br>
      <br>
      <span class="code">kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=0</span> is set which disables unprivileged user namespaces. User namespaces add a lot of attack surface for privilege escalation so they are disabled for unprivileged users. Because of this, bubblewrap has to be made setuid.

    </ul>

    <h2>Boot Parameters</h2>

    <p>
      Obscurix passes some parameters to the kernel at boot through the bootloader to increase security. These are documented below. <br>
      <br>
      <span class="code">apparmor=1 security=apparmor</span> are used to enable AppArmor. <br>
      <br>
      <span class="code">slab_nomerge</span> is used which disables merging of slabs of similar sizes as they can sometimes be used in a vulnerable way and be exploited. <br>
      <br>
      <span class="code">slub_debug=FZP</span> is used which enables redzoning, sanity checks and memory poisoning. Redzoning can help to prevent slabs from being overwritten past its size. Poisoning overwrites freed memory to prevent some use-after-free vulnerabilities. <br>
      <br>
      <span class="code">mce=0</span> is used which causes the kernel to panic on uncorrectable errors in ECC memory that could be exploited. <br>
      <br>
      <span class="code">page_poison=1</span> is used which overwrites freed memory. <br>
      <br>
      <span class="code">ipv6.disable=1</span> is used to disable the IPv6 stack which has some privacy issues, is not yet fully supported in Tor and adds extra attack surface. <br>
      <br>
      <span class="code">pti=on</span> is used to enable Kernel Page Table Isolation which prevents some KASLR bypasses and mitigates Meltdown. <br>
      <br>
      <span class="code">mds=full,nosmt</span> is used to enable all mitigations for the MDS vulnerability and disable smt which can be used to exploit the MDS vulnerability. <br>
      <br>
      <span class="code">intel_iommu=on amd_iommu=on</span> are used which enables IOMMU to prevent DMA attacks. <br>
      <br>
      <span class="code">modules.sig_enforce=1</span> is used which only allows kernel modules signed with a valid key to be loaded. Any kernel module signed with an invalid key or not signed at all will not be loaded. This increases security by making it much harder to load a malicious kernel module.

    <h2>Other</h2>

    <p>
      /proc is mounted with <span class="code">hidepid=2</span> to prevent users from seeing eachother's processes. systemd-logind is exempted from this by making it run within the proc group. This is needed for user sessions to work correctly.
