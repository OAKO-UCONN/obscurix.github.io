    <h1>Other Security Features</h1>

    <p>
      Other security features that do not fit in any of the other pages are documented here.
    </p>

    <h2>Umask</h2>

    <p>
      Umasks control the default file permissions of newly created files. The default umask in Obscurix is set to 0077 in /etc/profile.d/umask.sh. This makes new files only readable by the owner.
    </p>

    <h2>Mirrors</h2>

    <p>
      Pacman is configured to only use HTTPS mirrors. This prevents malicious exit nodes from injecting code during updates and it prevents exit nodes from seeing what you're downloading.
    </p>

    <h2>Thunar</h2>

    <p>
      Thunar is configured so it uses the ISO format for dates, disables thumbnails, disables thunar-volman and disables the network bookmark.
    </p>

    <h2>Entropy</h2>

    <p>
      Jitterentropy and haveged is installed by default to gather more entropy.
