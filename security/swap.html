    <h1>Swap</h1>

    <p>
      Swap can be used to write parts of RAM to disk. This is disabled as it could write important information such as passwords, encryption keys etc. to disk. <br>
      <br>
      It's disabled by setting <span class="code">vm.swappiness=0</span> in /etc/sysctl.d/swappiness.conf.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/Obscurix/Obscurix/blob/master/airootfs/etc/sysctl.d/swappiness.conf">https://github.com/Obscurix/Obscurix/blob/master/airootfs/etc/sysctl.d/swappiness.conf</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      /usr/bin/swapon is also replaced with a dummy binary that just runs /bin/true to prevent something from mounting a swap partition on the hard drive.
